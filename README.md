# Linear-Algebra

Implementation (from scratch) of various techniques to solve linear systems of equations.

The methods are:

- LU decomposition (Doolittle's method and Crout's method),
- Gauss-Seidel method,
- Successive-Over-Relaxation (SOR).

A description of the techniques and their implementation are provided in the notebook.
